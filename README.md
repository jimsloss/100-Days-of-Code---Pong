# 100-Days-of-Code---Pong
Udemy 100 Days of Code Bootcamp Project

Each day in the 100 days course is taking me at least 3 days, but cementing what I already know and building on that. Learning a lot!

Basic Recreation of the first video game PONG, using Pythons turtle package

Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys on the keyboard for right paddle movement, and the S and X keys for the left paddle movement.
Each time a point is earned it gets faster.

Simples

This is very basic and needs more work to be any good, but I learnt a lot from it and moved on

Feel free to reuse this code but love to hear from you if you do and see how you improve on it
